This image explains how to do hypothesis testing for a population mean (μ) when:

The population is normally distributed

The population variance (σ²) is known

Let’s break it down step by step so even a beginner can understand:

🔍 What is Hypothesis Testing?
Hypothesis testing helps us decide whether a claim (about a population mean, for example) is likely true or not based on sample data.

We test:

A null hypothesis (H₀): usually a statement of no change or no effect

An alternative hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ): what you want to prove

📌 This Case (Case 01):
You're testing the population mean (μ), and the variance (σ²) is known.

We use the Z-test in this case.

🧪 The Test Statistic:
The Z value is calculated using:

μ

  = value of mean under the null hypothesis

𝜎
σ = population standard deviation (known)

n = sample size

📊 Types of Alternative Hypotheses & Critical Regions
Alternative Hypothesis	When to Use It	Critical Region (Reject H₀ if...)
μ ≠ μ₀ (two-tailed)	Testing if mean is different	(
μ > μ₀ (right-tailed)	Testing if mean is greater

α
​
 
μ < μ₀ (left-tailed)	Testing if mean is less

Zₐ or Zₐ/₂ are values from the Z-table depending on your significance level (α) (e.g., 0.05).

✅ Example to Help You Understand:
Let’s say you want to test if the average height of students is not 170 cm.

H₀: μ = 170

Hₐ: μ ≠ 170 (two-tailed test)

You collect a sample, calculate 
𝑥

x

𝜎
σ, and n.

You plug values into the Z formula and:

Compare the result to the critical value from the Z-table (e.g., 1.96 for α = 0.05)

If

∣
>
1.96
∣Z∣>1.96, you reject H₀ and say the mean is not 170 cm

so what about right or left tail
ChatGPT said:
Great question! Let's go over right-tailed and left-tailed hypothesis tests in a simple and beginner-friendly way.

🎯 What are Tail Tests?
When doing hypothesis testing, the "tail" tells us where we are looking for extreme values (evidence against the null hypothesis).

🟥 Right-Tailed Test
✅ Use it when:
You want to test if the population mean is greater than a certain value.

🧪 Hypotheses:
H₀: μ = μ₀

H₁: μ > μ₀

🎯 Critical Region:
Z > Zα

If your calculated Z value is greater than the critical Z from the Z-table, then you reject H₀.

📊 Example:
You're testing if a new machine produces more items than the old average of 50.

H₀: μ = 50

H₁: μ > 50 → right-tailed

🟦 Left-Tailed Test
✅ Use it when:
You want to test if the population mean is less than a certain value.

🧪 Hypotheses:
H₀: μ = μ₀

H₁: μ < μ₀

🎯 Critical Region:
Z < -Zα

If your calculated Z value is less than the negative critical Z value, then you reject H₀.

📊 Example:
You're testing if a new diet reduces average weight from 70 kg.

H₀: μ = 70

H₁: μ < 70 → left-tailed

Would you like me to show you how to calculate Z and test using numbers in a right- or left-tailed test?

You said:
z(alpha) and z(alpha/2) is same for a confidence level when considering 2 tail and one tail
ChatGPT said:
Great question! Let's clear up the confusion around Z(α) and Z(α/2) and how they relate to one-tailed and two-tailed tests.

✅ The short answer:
No, Z(α) and Z(α/2) are not the same for the same confidence level.

They represent different cutoff points depending on whether you're doing a one-tailed or two-tailed test.

🎯 Why the difference?
Let’s suppose your confidence level is 95% → that means α = 0.05 (5% significance level).

🟩 One-Tailed Test:
The entire 5% rejection region is in one tail (either left or right).

So you look up Z(0.05) → the Z value that leaves 5% in one tail.

✅ Z(0.05) ≈ 1.645

🟦 Two-Tailed Test:
The 5% rejection area is split into two tails → 2.5% in each tail.

So you look up Z(0.025) → this gives you the Z value that leaves 2.5% in each tail.

✅ Z(0.025) ≈ 1.96

📊 Quick Comparison Table:
Confidence Level	α	One-Tailed Z(α)	Two-Tailed Z(α/2)
90%	0.10	1.28	1.645
95%	0.05	1.645	1.96
99%	0.01	2.33	2.576

🧠 Summary:
Use Z(α) for one-tailed tests.
